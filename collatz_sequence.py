#write a funtion named 'collatz' that has an argument named number.
#if the number is even, the collatz func should print and return- number//2
#if the number is odd, the collatz func should print and return- 3* number + 1
#let the user type in an integer
#run the collatz func on the typed number until it returns 1
#hint: to check if a number is even num % 2 == 0 , for odd - num % 2 == 10
